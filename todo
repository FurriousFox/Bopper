lapo:
- lapo (within 15 minutes before midnight ig, because of discord api limits)
- even if bot isn't in guild, in "private channels" (e.g. group dms) and servers bopper isn't member of (and show a "add Bopper" button)
- lapo: show "sent at, received at" footnote

/xkcd, xkcd subscribe (channel, dms)

ai convo, react to:
- replies
- threads

lapo:
- if cannot send "W00t", it shouldn't accept the lapo and instead add a cross
- reply to lapo message instead of just sending it in the channel
- what if the bot can't add a checkmark --> dm(?)

give rep, streak for non-ephemeral slash commands

streaks:
- all-time highscore, e.g. `<user>: 14 days (all-time: 72)`
- should editing a message count?

what happens if you .help in a channel where the bot may read, but not send
what happens if you add bot, without "bot" permissions?

ai:
- image input support (tried to get it working, doesn't seem to work properly)
- /ai model selection

rework bopper itself (e.g. mostly less manual database things)

sed:
- e.g. .s/something/something else
- similar to discord's built in feature
- but with support for regex

context menu commands:
- select multiple messages for /ai
- replace all context manu options with first running the command and then applying it using a single button in the context menu(?)
